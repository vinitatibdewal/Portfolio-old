            <h2 class="bio">The safety awareness of quadcopter pilots, and local residents’ experience with quadcopters, a probe </h2>
	</div>
    </div>
</div>
            <p>This project is set for the 2019 CHI student design competition, and our goal is to create a certain tool which helps 
people who are drone pilots to get better experience regarding drones, and also helps local residents to protect their 
right against drones if they hope so. Right now the angle we are after is about safety awareness, but based on the real 
result we get from the interview, this is subject to change.</p>

<p>In the early stage of the project, we will conduct interviews with about 10 different stakeholders we could find, 
asking them to share their experience as drone pilots, manufacturer, and local residents. Later we will create some tool, 
probably a smartphone application and/or a website, and conducting a usability test on 3 or 4 other people.</p>
	
	<p>The drone industry is a young but rapidly expanding one. There are half a million drones sold in recent years and 
people predict there will be 6 million drones around in 2020 in the U.S alone. The existence of drones creates 
a new problem in public safety. There have been around 2,000 drone accidents reported in the last two years in the U.S. 
alone, and a lot of them are caused by human errors. In this research, we aim to explore the experience of a drone pilot 
as a customer and an operator, to see if they have enough knowledge regarding safety operating a drone and whether it is 
easy for people to learn about drone safety. The drone pilots in question would be ones who don’t have extensive skills 
and thereby engage in this activity on a recreational or less serious basis. We also aim to probe normal people’s 
experience regarding their encounters with drones and see if they feel comfortable with this new technology 
(in particular, their views on public safety regarding drones). And moreover, we aim to find a few solutions to 
remedy the possible problem we find in the research.</p>
