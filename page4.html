        <p align="left">We wrote a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zsXHpz0PjO3Jv3RZjgdLmDQCvPL5aM3x"><strong>paper</strong></a> and made a poster and <a href="https://youtu.be/S6XthsnxeHE"><strong>video</strong></a> for the Student Design competition. </p>

        <H4 align="left"> Overview </H4>
        <p align="left">The proposed mobile application, Droney, aims at bridging the gap between the drone enthusiasts and the drone communities. It contains 4 major components, Maps, Discussions, Resources, and Marketplace. We designed it to serve as a mediator between an individual and the drone community. We aim to connect information seekers, experienced and novice pilots, educators, entrepreneurs, and general drone enthusiasts in order to build a seamless community that is dedicated to the drone sector.</p>
        
        <h4 align="left">UX Process</h4>
        <p align="left">Semi-Structured Interviews, Affinity Diagram, Mind Map, Information Architecture, Lo-Fi, Usability Testing, Hi-Fi</p>
        
        <h4 align="left">Initial Research & Findings</h4>
        <p align="left">We conducted 10 semi-structured interviews and attended a drone racing event on the invitation of one of out participants.From the interviews, we identified 2 major drone communities, the racer group and the photography group.The significant observations are mentioned in the following list:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc" align="left"> 
            <li><strong>Access to technical knowledge:</strong> Five participants mentioned that they struggled to decide which drone to buy due to the lack of technical knowledge and sources to gain the knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning to fly a drone:</strong> All the drone pilots claimed to have experienced a learning curve with their first drone flight. The drone community members mentioned that virtual training for beginners is a better way to learn.</li>
            <li><strong>Resources to identify flying areas:</strong> Individual pilots would rely on personal experience to look for a spot to fly their drone. As different purposes of flying require different terrains, pilots said that they end up spending hours and hours looking around for spots to fly.</li>
            <li><strong>Consideration about surroundings when flying:</strong> All drone pilots we interviewed showed great care of safety. They avoid people, complex terrain, open water-bodies, and traffic while flying.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulations:</strong> All the participants are well aware of the rules and regulations for flying drones, and they use different sources to check their flight compatibility with FAA regulations. Some of these sources were not reliable compared with the FAA provided app, B4UFly.</li>
            <li><strong>Drone race broadcast:</strong> Drone races are exciting to watch with the help of AR glasses to keep track of the drones. Without AR glasses, it is difficult for the spectators to follow what is happeningas the drones are quite small in size and fly fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Drone building:</strong> Three participants have experience building drones. They all faced the problems of troubleshooting through the crafting. They had to sort through a lot of online discussions to find the exact solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost of the drones:</strong> Drones are expensive. Amateurs prefer to buy cheap drones to practice flying. Some prefer building their own drones which is cheap and easy for part replacement.</li></ul>

        <h4 align="left">Prototype</h4>
        <p align="left">We first made the information architecture and then used UI pattern cards to decide the functionalities of our application. The cards were very useful as we were able to take fast decisions about the functions that are necessary for our design. After that, we made a low fidelity prototype and from that a medium fidelity prototype. The medium fidelity prototype was used to do the usability testing. We did three iterations of usability testing and changed our design according to the participant feedback.</p>

        <h5 align="left">Medium Fidelity Prototype</h5>
        <p align="left"> <strong> Onboarding: </strong> After the first usability test, we understood that it was necessary to ask some basic questions to the participants about their interests and experience in the drone community. It will give them personalized results.</p>

        <div class="ten columns portfolio">
        <p align="left"> <strong> Home Page: </strong> In the first design, "Maps" was the home screen. This was confusing for the participants as there was no context available. So, we added a home screen which can redirect them to the desired functions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="six columns portfolio">
        <p align="left"> <strong> Maps: </strong> The design of "Maps" went through various changes. The biggest issue here was the "Hamburger Menu". Maps screen would open up and the participants would look confused, what to do next? Out of 7 participants in the usability testing, only 1 noticed the menu. So, we replaced it with a "Floating Action Button". </p>

        <p align="left"> <strong> Discussions: </strong> A simple concept of Gamification is added in this section to encourage the users to ask more questions and give more answers. </p>
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p align="left"> <strong> Marketplace: </strong> Our participants complained that the drones and drone parts are very costly. So, to solve this issue, we designed Marketplace. The drone pilots can sell their old drones or drone parts at a cheaper price here. Verified sellers can also use this platform to reach out to more people. </p>

        <div class="eight columns portfolio">
        <p align="left"> <strong> Resources: </strong> Here the users can find every information related to drones and drone flying. We have also added a unique feature called "Talk to a Mentor". Here, the new pilots can get one on one guidance from the experts in that field. The mentors can use this platform to publicize their organization or just to share knowledge. In the Hi-Fi design, we changed this feature to "Talk to the Expert".</p>

        <h5 align="left">High Fidelity Prototype</h5>
        <p align="left">We created few screens for the high fidelity prototype. The most important functionality that we included in this design is the conversational UI. A search bar is added on the top of every screen and it acts as an assistant to the person who is using this application. </p>
